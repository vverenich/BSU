"If  you  have  nothing  better  to  do,  Count  [or 
Prince],  and  if  the  prospect  of  spending  an 
evening  with  a  poor  invalid  is  not  too  terrible, 
I  shall  be  very  charmed  to  see  you  tonight  be- 
tween 7  and  10— Annette  Sch^rer." 

"Heavens!  what  a  virulent  attack!"  replied 
the  prince,  not  in  the  least  disconcerted  by  this 
reception.  He  had  just  entered,  wearing  an  em- 
broidered court  uniform,  knee  breeches,  and 
shoes,  and  had  stars  on  his  breast  and  a  serene 
expression  on  his  flat  face.  He  spoke  in  that 
refined  French  in  which  our  grandfathers  not 
only  spoke  but  thought,  and  with  the  gentle, 
patronizing  intonation  natural  to  a  man  of 
importance  who  had  grown  old  in  society  and 
at  court.  He  went  up  to  Anna  Pavlovna,  kissed 
her  hand,  presenting  to  her  his  bald,  scented, 
and  shining  head,  and  complacently  seated 
himself  on  the  sofa. 

"First  of  all,  dear  friend,  tell  me  how  you 


are.  Set  your  friend's  mind  at  rest,"  said  he 
without  altering  his  tone,  beneath  the  polite- 
ness and  affected  sympathy  of  which  indiffer- 
ence and  even  irony  could  be  discerned. 

"Can  one  be  well  while  suffering  morally? 
Can  one  be  calm  in  tirrfes  like  these  if  one  has 
any  feeling?"  said  Anna  Pdvlovna.  "You  are 
staying  the  whole  evening,  I  hope?" 

"And  the  fete  at  the  English  ambassador's? 
Today  is  Wednesday.  I  must  put  in  an  appear- 
ance there,"  said  the  prince.  "My  daughter  is 
coming  for  me  to  take  me  there." 

"I  thought  today's  fete  had  been  canceled. 
I  confess  all  these  festivities  and  fireworks  are 
becoming  wearisome." 

"If  they  had  known  that  you  wished  it,  the 
entertainment  would  have  been  put  off,"  said 
the  prince,  who,  like  a  wound-up  clock,  by 
force  of  habit  said  things  he  did  not  even  wish 
to  be  believed. 

"Don't  tease!  Well,  and  what  has  been  de- 
cided about  Novosiltsev's  dispatch?  You  know 
everything." 

"What  can  one  say  about  it?"  replied  the 
prince  in  a  cold,  listless  tone.  "What  has  been 
decided?  They  have  decided  that  Buonaparte 
has  burnt  his  boats,  and  I  believe  that  we  are 
ready  to  burn  ours." 

Prince  Vastti  always  spoke  languidly,  like 
an  actor  repeating  a  stale  part.  Anna  Pdvlovna 
Scherer  on  the  contrary,  despite  her  forty  years, 
overflowed  with  animation  and  impulsiveness. 
To  be  an  enthusiast  had  become  her  social  vo- 
cation and,  sometimes  even  when  she  did  not 
feel  like  it,  she  became  enthusiastic  in  order 
not  to  disappoint  the  expectations  of  those 
who  knew  her.  The  subdued  smile  which, 
though  it  did  not  suit  her  faded  features,  al- 
ways played  round  her  lips  expressed,  as  in  a 
spoiled  child,  a  continual  consciousness  of  her 
charming  defect,  which  she  neither  wished,  nor 
could,  nor  considered  it  necessary,  to  correct. 

In  the  midst  of  a  conversation  on  political 
matters  Anna  Pdvlovna  burst  out: 

"Oh,  don't  speak  to  me  of  Austria.  Perhaps 


WAR  AND  PEACE 


I  don't  understand  things,  but  Austria  never 
has  wished,  and  does  not  wish,  for  war.  She  is 
betraying  us!  Russia  alone  must  save  Europe. 
Our  gracious  sovereign  recognizes  his  high  vo- 
cation and  will  be  true  to  it.  That  is  the  one 
thing  I  have  faith  in!  Our  good  and  wonder- 
ful sovereign  has  to  perfonn  the  noblest  role 
on  earth,  and  he  is  so  virtuous  and  noble  that 
God  will  not  forsake  him.  He  will  fulfill  his 
vocation  and  crush  the  hydra  of  revolution, 
which  has  become  more  terrible  than  ever  in 
the  person  of  this  murderer  and  villain!  We 
alone  must  avenge  the  blood  of  the  just  one. 
. . .  Whom,  I  ask  you,  can  we  rely  on?  . . .  Eng- 
land with  her  commercial  spirit  will  not  and 
cannot  understand  the  Emperor  Alexander's 
loftiness  of  soul.  She  tias  refused  to  evacuate 
Malta.  She  wanted  to  find,  and  still  seeks,  some 
secret  motive  in  our  actions.  What  answer  did 
Novosiltsev  get?  None.  The  English  have  not 
understood  and  cannot  understand  the  self- 
abnegation  of  our  Emperor  who  wants  noth- 
ing for  himself,  but  only  desires  the  good  of 
mankind.  And  what  have  they  promised?  Noth- 
ing! And  what  little  they  have  promised  they 
will  not  perform!  Prussia  has  always  declared 
that  Buonaparte  is  invincible  and  that  all 
Europe  is  powerless  before  him.  .  .  .  And  I 
don't  believe  a  word  that  Hardenburg  says, 
or  Haugwitz  either.  This  famous  Prussian  neu- 
trality is  just  a  trap.  I  have  faith  only  in  God 
and  the  lofty  destiny  of  our  adored  monarch. 
He  will  save  Europe!" 

She  suddenly  paused,  smiling  at  her  own 
impetuosity. 

"I  think,"  said  the  prince  with  a  smile,  "that 
if  you  had  been  sent  instead  of  our  dear 
Wintzingerode  you  would  have  captured  the 
King  of  Prussia's  consent  by  assault.  You  are 
so  eloquent.  Will  you  give  me  a  cup  of  tea?" 

"In  a  moment.  X  propos"she  added,  becom- 
ing calm  again,  "I  am  expecting  two  very  in- 
teresting men  tonight,  le  Vicomte  de  Morte- 
mart,  who  is  connected  with  the  Montmoren- 
cys  through  the  Rohans,oneof  the  best  French 
families.  He  is  one  of  the  genuine  dmigrh,  the 
good  ones.  And  also  the  Abbe*  Morio.  Do  you 
know  that  profound  thinker?  He  has  been  re- 
ceived by  the  Emperor.  Had  you  heard?" 

"I  shall  be  delighted  to  meet  them,"  said  the 
prince.  "But  tell  me,"  he  added  with  studied 
carelessness  as  if  it  had  only  just  occurred  to 
him,  though  the  question  he  was  about  to  ask 
was  the  chief  motive  of  his  visit,  "is  it  true  that 
the  Dowager  Empress  wants  Baron  Funke  to  be 
appointed  first  secretary  at  Vienna?  The  baron 


by  all  accounts  is  a  poor  creature." 

Prince  Vasfli  wished  to  obtain  this  post  for 
his  son,  but  others  were  trying  through  the 
Dowager  Empress  Mdrya  Fedorovna  to  secure 
it  for  the  baron. 

Anna  Pdvlovna  almost  closed  her  eyes  to  in- 
dicate that  neither  she  nor  anyone  else  had  a 
right  to  criticize  what  the  Empress  desired  or 
was  pleased  with. 

"Baron  Funke  has  been  recommended  to  the 
Dowager  Empress  by  her  sister,"  was  all  she 
said,  in  a  dry  and  mournful  tone. 

As  she  named  the  Empress,  Anna  Pdvlovna's 
face  suddenly  assumed  an  expression  of  pro- 
found and  sincere  devotion  and  respect  min- 
gled with  sadness, and  thisoccurred  every  time 
she  mentioned  her  illustrious  patroness.  She 
added  that  Her  Majesty  had  deigned  to  show 
Baron  Funke  beaucoup  d'estime,  and  again 
her  face  clouded  over  with  sadness. 

The  prince  was  silent  and  looked  indiffer- 
ent. But,  with  the  womanly  and  courtierlike 
quickness  and  tact  habitual  to  her,  Anna  Pdv- 
lovna wished  both  to  rebuke  him  (for  daring 
to  speak  as  he  had  done  of  a  man  recommended 
to  the  Empress)  and  at  the  same  time  to  con- 
sole him,  so  she  said: 

"Now  about  your  family.  Do  you  know  that 
since  your  daughter  came  out  everyone  has 
been  enraptured  by  her?  They  say  she  is  amaz- 
ingly beautiful." 

The  prince  bowed  to  signify  his  respect  and 
gratitude. 

"I  often  think,"  she  continued  after  a  short 
pause,  drawing  nearer  to  the  prince  and  smil- 
ing amiably  at  him  as  if  to  show  that  political 
and  social  topics  were  ended  and  the  time  had 
come  for  intimate  conversation— "I  often  think 
how  unfairly  sometimes  the  joys  of  life  are  dis- 
tributed. Why  has  fate  given  you  two  such 
splendid  children?  I  don't  speak  of  Anatole, 
your  youngest.  I  don't  like  him,"  she  added  in 
a  tone  admitting  of  no  rejoinder  and  raising 
her  eyebrows.  "Two  such  charming  children. 
And  really  you  appreciate  them  less  than  any- 
one, and  so  you  don't  deserve  to  have  them." 

And  she  smiled  her  ecstatic  smile. 

"I  can't  help  it,"  said  the  prince.  "Lavater 
would  have  said  I  lack  the  bump  of  paternity." 

"Don't  joke;  I  mean  to  have  a  serious  talk 
with  you.  Do  you  know  I  am  dissatisfied  with 
your  younger  son?  Between  ourselves"  (and 
her  face  assumed  its  melancholy  expression), 
"he  was  mentioned  at  Her  Majesty's  and  you 
were  pitied.  .  .  ." 

The   prince  answered   nothing,   but  she 


BOOK  ONE 


looked  at  him  significantly,  awaiting  a  reply. 
He  frowned. 

"What  would  you  have  me  do?"  he  said  at 
last.  "You  know  I  did  all  a  father  could  for 
their  education,  and  they  have  both  turned 
out  fools.  Hippolyte  is  at  least  a  quiet  fool,  but 
Anatole  is  an  active  one.  That  is  the  only  dif- 
ference between  them."  He  said  this  smiling 
in  a  way  more  natural  and  animated  than 
usual,  so  that  the  wrinkles  round  his  mouth 
very  clearly  revealed  something  unexpectedly 
coarse  and  unpleasant. 

"And  why  are  children  born  to  such  men  as 
you?  If  you  were  not  a  father  there  would  be 
nothing  I  could  reproach  you  with,"  said  Anna 
Pdvlovna,  looking  up  pensively. 

"I  am  your  faithful  slave  and  to  you  alone  I 
can  confess  that  my  children  are  the  bane  of 
my  life.  It  is  the  cross  I  have  to  bear.  That  is 
how  I  explain  it  to  myself.  It  can't  be  helped!" 

He  said  no  more,  but  expressed  his  resigna- 
tion to  cruel  fate  by  a  gesture.  Anna  Pdvlovna 
meditated. 

"Have  you  never  thought  of  marrying  your 
prodigal  son  Anatole?"  she  asked.  "They  say 
old  maids  have  a  mania  for  matchmaking,  and 
though  I  don't  feel  that  weakness  in  myself  as 
yet,  I  know  a  little  person  who  is  very  unhappy 
with  her  father.  She  is  a  relation  of  yours, 
Princess  Mary  Bolk6nskaya." 

Prince  Vasili  did  not  reply,  though,  with  the 
quickness  of  memory  and  perception  befitting 
a  man  of  the  world,  he  indicated  by  a  move- 
ment of  the  head  that  he  was  considering  this 
information. 

"Do  you  know,"  he  said  at  last,  evidently 
unable  to  check  the  sad  current  of  his  thoughts, 
"that  Anatole  is  costing  me  forty  thousand 
rubles  a  year?  And,"  he  went  on  after  a  pause, 
"what  will  it  be  in  five  years,  if  he  goes  on  like 
this?"  Presently  he  added:  "That's  what  we 

fathers  have  to  put  up  with Is  this  princess 

of  yours  rich?" 

"Her  father  is  very  rich  and  stingy.  He  lives 
in  the  country.  He  is  the  well-known  Prince 
Bolk6nski  who  had  to  retire  from  the  army  un- 
der the  late  Emperor,  and  was  nicknamed  'the 
King  of  Prussia.'  He  is  very  clever  but  eccen- 
tric, and  a  bore.  The  poor  girl  is  very  unhappy. 
She  has  a  brother;  I  think  you  know  him,  he 
married  Lise  Meinen  lately.  He  is  an  aide-de- 
camp of  Kutiizov's  and  will  be  here  tonight." 

"Listen,  dear  Annette,"  said  the  prince,  sud- 
denly taking  Anna  Pdvlovna's  hand  and  for 
some  reason  drawing  it  downwards.  "Arrange 
that  affair  for  me  and  I  shall  always  be  your 


most  devoted  slave— slaje  with  an  /,  as  a  village 
elder  of  mine  writes  in  his  reports.  She  is  rich 
and  of  good  family  and  that's  all  I  want." 

And  with  the  familiarity  and  easy  grace 
peculiar  to  him,  he  raised  the  maid  of  honor's 
hand  to  his  lips,  kissed  it,  and  swung  it  to  and 
fro  as  he  lay  back  in  his  armchair,  looking  in 
another  direction. 

"Attendee"  said  Anna  Pdvlovna,  reflecting, 
"I'll  speak  to  Lise,  young  Bolk6nski's  wife,  this 
very  evening,  and  perhaps  the  thing  can  be 
arranged.  It  shall  be  on  your  family's  behalf 
that  I'll  start  my  apprenticeship  as  old  maid." 

CHAPTER  II 

ANNA  PAVLOVNA'S  drawing  room  was  gradually 
filling.  The  highest  Petersburg  society  was  as- 
sembled there:  people  differing  widely  in  age 
and  character  but  alike  in  the  social  circle  to 
which  they  belonged.  Prince  Vasili's  daughter, 
the  beautiful  H£l£ne,  came  to  take  her  father 
to  the  ambassador's  entertainment;  she  wore  a 
ball  dress  and  her  badge  as  maid  of  honor.  The 
youthful  little  Princess  Bolkonskaya,  known 
as  la  femme  la  plus  sSduisante  de  Pfaersbourg? 
was  also  there.  She  had  been  married  during 
the  previous  winter,  and  being  pregnant  did 
not  go  to  any  large  gatherings,  but  only  to  small 
receptions.  Prince  Vasfli's  son,  Hippolyte,  had 
come  with  Mortemart,  whom  he  introduced. 
The  Abb6  Morio  and  many  others  had  also 
come. 

To  each  new  arrival  Anna  Pdvlovna  safcl, 
"You  have  not  yet  seen  my  aunt,"  or  "You  do 
not  know  my  aunt?"  and  very  gravely  con- 
ducted him  or  her  to  a  little  old  lady,  wearing 
large  bows  of  ribbon  in  her  cap,  who  had  come 
sailing  in  from  another  room  as  soon  as  the 
guests  began  to  arrive;  and  slowly  turning  her 
eyes  from  the  visitor  to  her  aunt,  Anna  Pdv- 
lovna mentioned  each  one's  name  and  then 
left  them. 

Each  visitor  performed  the  ceremony  of 
greeting  this  old  aunt  whom  not  one  of  them 
knew,  not  one  of  them  wanted  to  know,  and 
not  one  of  them  cared  about;  Anna  Pdvlovna 
observed  these  greetings  with  mournful  and  sol- 
emn interest  and  silent  approval.  The  aunt 
spoke  to  each  of  them  in  the  same  words,  about 
their  health  and  her  own,  and  the  health  of 
Her  Majesty,  "who,  thank  God,  was  better  to- 
day." And  each  visitor,  though  politeness  pre- 
vented his  showing  impatience,  left  the  old 
woman  with  a  sense  of  relief  at  having  per- 
formed a  vexatious  duty  and  did  not  return  to

WAR  AND  PEACE 


her  the  whole  evening. 

The  young  Princess  Bolk6nskaya  had 
brought  some  work  in  a  gold-embroidered  vel- 
vet bag.  Her  pretty  little  upper  lip,  on  which 
a  delicate  dark  down  was  just  perceptible,  was 
too  short  for  her  teeth,  but  it  lifted  all  the  more 
sweetly,  and  was  especially  charming  when  she 
occasionally  drew  it  down  to  meet  the  lower 
lip.  As  is  always  the  case  with  a  thoroughly  at- 
tractive woman,  her  defect—the  shortness  of 
her  upperlip  and  her  half-open  mouth— seemed 
to  be  her  own  special  and  peculiar  form  of 
beauty.  Everyone  brightened  at  the  sight  of 
this  pretty  young  woman,  so  soon  to  become 
a  mother,  so  full  of  life  and  health,  and  carry- 
ing her  burden  so  lightly.  Old  men  and  dull 
dispirited  young  ones  who  looked  at  her,  after 
being  in  her  company  and  talking  to  her  a 
litttle  while,  felt  as  if  they  too  were  becoming, 
like  her,  full  of  life  and  health.  All  who  talked 
to  her,  and  at  each  word  saw  her  bright  smile 
and  the  constant  gleam  of  her  white  teeth, 
thought  that  they  were  in  a  specially  amiable 
mood  that  day. 

The  little  princess  went  round  the  table 
with  quick,  short,  swaying  steps,  her  workbag 
on  her  arm,  and  gaily  spreading  out  her  dress 
sat  down  on  a  sofa  near  the  silver  samovar,  as 
if  all  she  was  doing  was  a  pleasure  to  herself 
and  to  all  around  her.  "I  have  brought  my 
work,"  said  she  in  French,  displaying  her  bag 
and  addressing  all  present.  "Mind,  Annette, 
I  hope  you  have  not  played  a  wicked  trick  on 
me,"  she  added,  turning  to  her  hostess.  "You 
wrote  that  it  was  to  be  quite  a  small  reception, 
and  just  see  how  badly  I  am  dressed."  And  she 
spread  out  her  arms  to  show  her  short-waisted, 
lace-trimmed,  dainty  gray  dress,  girdled  with 
a  broad  ribbon  just  below  the  breast. 

"Soyez  tranquille,  Lise,  you  will  always  be 
prettier  than  anyone  else,"  replied  Anna  Pdv- 
lovna. 

"You  know/'  said  the  princess  in  the  same 
tone  of  voice  and  still  in  French,  turning  to  a 
general,  "my  husband  is  deserting  me?  He  is 
going  to  get  himself  killed.  Tell  me  what  this 
wretched  war  is  for?"  she  added,  addressing 
Prince  Vasfli,  and  without  waiting  for  an  an- 
swer she  turned  to  speak  to  his  daughter,  the 
beautiful  H£l£ne. 

"What  a  delightful  woman  this  little  prin- 
cess isl"  said  Prince  Vasili  to  Anna  Pdvlovna. 

One  of  the  next  arrivals  was  a  stout,  heavily 
built  young  man  with  close-cropped  hair,  spec- 
tacles, the  light-colored  breeches  fashionable 
at  that  time,  a  very  high  ruffle,  and  a  brown 


dress  coat.  This  stout  young  man  was  an  illegit- 
imate son^of  Count  Bezukhov,  a  well-known 
grandee  of  Catherine's  time  who  now  lay  dy- 
ing in  Moscow.  The  young  man  had  not  yet 
entered  either  the  military  or  civil  service,  as 
he  had  only  just  returned  from  abroad  where 
he  had  been  educated,  and  this  was  his  first  ap- 
pearance in  society.  Anna  Pdvlovna  greeted 
him  with  the  nod  she  accorded  to  the  lowest 
hierarchy  in  her  drawing  room.  But  in  spite  of 
this  lowest-grade  greeting,  a  look  of  anxiety 
and  fear,  as  at  the  sight  of  something  too  large 
and  unsuited  to  the  place,  came  over  her  face 
when  she  saw  Pierre  enter.  Though  he  was  cer- 
tainly rather  bigger  than  the  other  men  in  the 
room,  her  anxiety  could  only  have  reference 
to  the  clever  though  shy,  but  observant  and 
natural,  expression  which  distinguished  him 
from  everyone  else  in  that  drawing  room. 

"It  is  very  good  of  you,  Monsieur  Pierre,  to 
come  and  visit  a  poor  invalid,"  said  Anna  Pdv- 
lovna,  exchanging  an  alarmed  glance  with  her 
aunt  as  she  conducted  him  to  her. 

Pierre  murmured  something  unintelligible, 
and  continued  to  look  round  as  if  in  search  of 
something.  On  his  way  to  the  aunt  he  bowed 
to  the  little  princess  with  a  pleased  smile,  as  to 
an  intimate  acquaintance. 

Anna  Pdvlovna's  alarm  was  justified,  for 
Pierre  turned  away  from  the  aunt  without  wait- 
ing to  hear  her  speech  about  Her  Majesty's 
health.  Anna  Pdvlovna  in  dismay  detained 
him  with  the  words:  "Do  you  know  the  Abbe* 
Morio?  He  is  a  most  interesting  man." 

"Yes,  I  have  heard  of  his  scheme  for  perpet- 
ual peace,  and  it  is  very  interesting  but  hardly 
feasible." 

"You  think  so?"  rejoined  Anna  Pdvlovna  in 
order  to  say  something  and  get  away  to  attend 
to  her  duties  as  hostess.  But  Pierre  now  com- 
mitted a  reverse  act  of  impoliteness.  First  he 
had  left  a  lady  before  she  had  finished  speak- 
ing to  him,  and  now  he  continued  to  speak  to 
another  who  wished  to  getaway.  With  his  head 
bent,  and  his  big  feet  spread  apart,  he  began 
explaining  his  reasons  for  thinking  the  abbess 
plan  chimerical. 

"We  will  talk  of  it  later,"  said  Anna  Pdv- 
lovna  with  a  smile. 

And  having  got  rid  of  this  young  man  who 
did  not  know  how  to  behave,  she  resumed  her 
duties  as  hostess  and  continued  to  listen  and 
watch,  ready  to  help  at  any  point  where  the 
conversation  might  happen  to  flag.  As  the  fore- 
man of  a  spinning  mill,  when  he  has  set  the 
hands  to  work,  goes  round  and  notices  here  a 


BOOK  ONE 


spindle  that  has  stopped  or  there  one  that 
creaks  or  makes  more  noise  than  it  should,  and 
hastens  to  check  the  machine  or  set  it  in  proper 
motion,  so  Anna  Pavlovna  moved  about  her 
drawing  room,  approaching  now  a  silent,  now 
a  too-noisy  group,  and  by  a  word  or  slight  re- 
arrangement kept  the  conversational  machine 
in  steady,  proper,  and  regular  motion.  But 
amid  these  cares  her  anxiety  about  Pierre  was 
evident.  She  kept  an  anxious  watch  on  him 
when  he  approached  the  group  round  Morte- 
mart  to  listen  to  what  was  being  said  there,  and 
again  when  he  passed  to  another  group  whose 
center  was  the  abbe*. 

Pierre  had  been  educated  abroad,  and  this 
reception  at  Anna  Pavlovna's  was  the  first  he 
had  attended  in  Russia.  He  knew  that  all  the 
intellectual  lights  of  Petersburg  were  gathered 
there  and,  like  a  child  in  a  toyshop,  did  not 
know  which  way  to  look,  afraid  of  missing  any 
clever  conversation  that  was  to  be  heard.  See- 
ing the  self-confident  and  refined  expression 
on  the  faces  of  those  present  he  was  always  ex- 
pecting to  hear  something  very  profound.  At 
last  he  came  up  to  Morio.  Here  the  conversa- 
tion seemed  interesting  and  he  stood  waiting 
for  an  opportunity  to  express  his  own  views, 
as  young  people  are  fond  of  doing. 

CHAPTER  III 

ANNA  PAVLOVNA'S  reception  was  in  full  swing. 
The  spindles  hummed  steadily  and  ceaselessly 
on  all  sides.  With  the  exception  of  the  aunt, 
beside  whom  sat  only  one  elderly  lady,  who 
with  her  thin  careworn  face  was  rather  out  of 
place  in  this  brilliant  society,  the  whole  com- 
pany had  settled  into  three  groups.  One,  chiefly 
masculine,  had  formed  round  the  abbe".  An- 
other, of  young  people,  was  grouped  round 
the  beautiful  Princess  H£l£ne,  Prince  Vasfli's 
daughter,  and  the  little  Princess  Bolk6nskaya, 
very  pretty  and  rosy,  though  rather  too  plump 
for  her  age.  The  third  group  was  gathered 
round  Mortemart  and  Anna  Pavlovna. 

The  vicomte  was  a  nice-looking  young  man 
with  soft  features  and  polished  manners,  who 
evidently  considered  himself  a  celebrity  but 
out  of  politeness  modestly  placed  himself  at 
the  disposal  of  the  circle  in  which  he  found 
himself.  Anna  Pdvlovna  was  obviously  serving 
him  up  as  a  treat  to  her  guests.  As  a  clever 
maitre  d'hotel  serves  up  as  a  specially  choice 
delicacy  a  piece  of  meat  that  no  one  who  had 
seen  it  in  the  kitchen  would  have  cared  to  eat, 
so  Anna  Pavlovna  served  up  to  her  guests,  first 
the  vicomte  and  then  the  abbe*,  as  peculiarly 


choice  morsels.  The  group  about  Mortemart 
immediately  began  discussing  the  murder  of  the 
Due  d'Enghien.  The  vicomte  said  that  the  Due 
d'Enghien  had  perished  by  his  own  magna- 
nimity, and  that  there  were  particular  reasons 
for  Buonaparte's  hatred  of  him. 

"Ah,  yes!  Do  tell  us  all  about  it,  Vicomte," 
said  Anna  Pdvlovna,  with  a  pleasant  feeling 
that  there  was  something  a  la  Louis  XV  in  the 
sound  of  that  sentence:  "Contez  nous  gela, 
Vicomte." 

The  vicomte  bowed  and  smiled  courteously 
in  token  of  his  willingness  to  comply.  Anna 
Pavlovna  arranged  a  group  round  him,  invit- 
ing everyone  to  listen  to  his  tale. 

"The  vicomte  knew  the  due  personally," 
whispered  Anna  Pdvlovna  to  one  of  the  guests. 
"The  vicomte  is  a  wonderful  raconteur,"  said 
she  to  another.  "How  evidently  he  belongs  to 
the  best  society,"  said  she  to  a  third;  and  the 
vicomte  was  served  up  to  the  company  in  the 
choicest  and  most  advantageous  style,  like  a 
well-garnished  joint  of  roast  beef  on  a  hot 
dish. 

The  vicomte  wished  to  begin  his  story  and 
gave  a  subtle  smile. 

"Come  over  here,  H£l£ne,  dear,"  said  Anna 
P£vlovna  to  the  beautiful  young  princess  who 
was  sitting  some  way  off,  the  center  of  another 
group. 

The  princess  smiled.  She  rose  with  the  same 
unchanging  smile  with  which  she  had  first  en- 
tered the  room— the  smile  of  a  perfectly  beauti- 
ful woman.  With  a  slight  rustle  of  her  white 
dress  trimmed  with  moss  and  ivy,  with  a  gleam 
of  white  shoulders,  glossy  hair,  and  sparkling 
diamonds,  she  passed  between  the  men  who 
made  way  for  her,  not  looking  at  any  of  them 
but  smiling  on  all,  as  if  graciously  allowing 
each  the  privilege  of  admiring  her  beautiful 
figure  and  shapely  shoulders,  back,  and  bosom 
—which  in  the  fashion  of  those  days  were  very 
much  exposed— and  she  seemed  to  bring  the 
glamour  of  a  ballroom  with  her  as  she  moved 
toward  Anna  Pavlovna.  H£lene  was  so  lovely 
that  not  only  did  she  not  show  any  trace  of 
coquetry,  but  on  the  contrary  she  even  appeared 
shy  of  her  unquestionable  and  all  too  victori- 
ous beauty.  She  seemed  to  wish,  but  to  be  un- 
able, to  diminish  its  effect. 

"How  lovely!"  said  everyone  who  saw  her; 
and  the  vicomte  lifted  his  shoulders  and 
dropped  his  eyes  as  if  startled  by  something  ex- 
traordinary when  she  took  her  seat  opposite  and 
beamed  upon  him  also  with  her  unchanging 
smile.
